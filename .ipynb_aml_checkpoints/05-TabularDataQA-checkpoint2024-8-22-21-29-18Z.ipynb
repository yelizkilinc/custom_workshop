        "To really have a Smart Search Engine or Virtual assistant that can answer any question about your corporate documents, this \"engine\" must understand tabular data, aka, sources with tables, rows and columns with numbers. \nThis is a different problem that simply looking for the top most similar results.  **The concept of indexing, bringing top results, embedding, doing a cosine semantic search and summarize an answer, doesn't really apply to this problem.\nWe are dealing now with sources with Tables in which each row and column are related to each other, and in order to answer a question, all of the data is needed, not just top results.**\n\nIn this notebook, the goal is to show how to deal with this kind of use cases. To continue with our Covid-19 theme, we will be using an open dataset called [\"Covid Tracking Project\"](https://covidtracking.com/data/download). The COVID Tracking Project dataset is a  CSV file that provides the latest numbers on tests, confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and patient outcomes from every US state and territory (they stopped tracking on March 7 2021).\n\n**Imagine that many documents on a data lake are tabular data, or that your use case is to ask questions in natural language to a LLM model and this model needs to get the context from a CSV file or even a SQL Database in order to answer the question.** A GPT Smart Search Engine, must understand how to deal with this sources, understand the data and answer acoordingly."
